# Backend Service API and Hypermedia

**All API Hypermedia learned routes are obtained through both Web and Mobile home endpoints**.

### Media-Types

The Backend Service API makes use of two different media-types:
* `application/vnd.siren+json` : For representation of sucessful operations and Backend Service resources.
* `application/problem+json` : For representation of operations that resulted in a error.

### Hypermedia Specification

The adopted Hypermedia specification is [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren).

Siren is a hypermedia format that allows the addition of metadata to the responses,
that can be used to navigate through the API.

> "Siren is a hypermedia specification for representing entities. 
> As HTML is used for visually representing documents on a Web site, 
> Siren is a specification for presenting entities via a Web API. 
> Siren offers structures to communicate information about entities, 
> actions for executing state transitions, and links for client navigation."
> 
> `Siren - Specification`

The API adopted Siren format is composed by the following fields:

- `class` {String}: The class of the entity. It can be a single class or a list of classes.
- `properties`: The properties of the entity [see [Hypermedia Properties Representations](#hypermedia-properties-representations)].
- `entities`: An Entity is a URI-addressable resource that has properties and actions associated with it. It may contain sub-entities and navigational links.
  - `properties`: A set of key-value pairs that describe the state of an entity. In JSON Siren, this is an object such as { "name": "Kevin", "age": 30 }. Optional.
  - `rel`: Defines the relationship of the sub-entity to its parent, per [Web Linking (RFC5988)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) and Link Relations. MUST be a non-empty array of strings. Required.
  - `links`: A collection of items that describe navigational links, distinct from entity relationships. Link items should contain a rel attribute to describe the relationship and an href attribute to point to the target URI. Entities should include a link rel to self. In JSON Siren, this is represented as "links": [{ "rel": ["self"], "href": "http://api/classroom/1234" }]. Optional.
- `actions`: The actions that can be performed on the entity.
  - `name` {String}: Identifies the action to be performed.
  - `method` {String}: The HTTP method of the action.
  - `href` {URI}: The URI of the action.
  - `title` {String}: Descriptive text about the action.
  - `type` {String}: The encoding type for the request.
  - `fields`: Fields represent controls inside actions.
    - `type` {String}: The input type of the field.
    - `value`: A value assigned to the field.
    - `title` {String}: Textual annotation of a field.
- `links`: Represent navigational transitions.
  - `rel` : List of relations of the link to its entity.
  - `href` {String}: The URI of the linked resource.
  - `needAuthentication` {Boolean}: Defines if access to the link requires API authentication.

### Hypermedia Error Representation

[Problem Json](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) is a standard specification to represent any error thrown by an API.

> The purpose of Problem is so that “API [consumers] can be informed of both the high-level error class (using the status code) and the finer-grained details of the problem”.

The API adopted Problem Json representation is composed by:

- `title` {String}: Short human-readable summary of the problem.
- `detail` {String}: Human-readable description of this specific problem.
- `type` {URI}: An absolute URL that leads to a page containing human-readable documentation regarding the problem.
